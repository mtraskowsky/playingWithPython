Various python projects

I am using streamlit to build some visual web apps using python.

To download streamlit:

1. Visit https://www.streamlit.io/
2. In the terminal (for Mac users), type in 'pip install streamlit'
3. You can type 'streamlit hello' and should see a localhost URL pop up. Sucessfully installed!

To run a file, navigate to where the file is stored. For example, if your code is written in a file called pythonapp.py, and it is 
saved to your Desktop, navigate to the Desktop folder using the command line. Once you have reached the folder where your file is saved,
type into the terminal 'streamlit run pythonapp.py', replacing 'pytonapp.py' with the name of the file of the file you want to run. 

You should see a browser window pop up with your code running! Easy as that.
